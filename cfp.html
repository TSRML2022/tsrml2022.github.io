We invite submissions on <b>any aspect of trustworthy and socially responsible machine learning</b>, which includes but not limited to:
<ul>
  <li>Novel methods for building more trustworthy machine learning models that prevent or alleviate negative societal impacts of existing machine learning methods</li>
  <li>New applications and settings where trustworthiness of machine learning plays an important role and how well existing techniques work under these settings</li>
  <li>New connections and mutual interactions between various aspects and properties of trustworthy and socially responsible ML: security, robustness, privacy, fairness, ethics, interpretability, transparency, etc.</li>
  <li>Futuristic concerns on trustworthiness and societal impact of existing machine learning systems</li>
  <li>Machine learning models with verifiable guarantees (such as robustness, fairness and privacy guarantees) to build trustworthiness</li>
  <li>Privacy-preserving machine learning approaches</li>
  <li>Theoretical understanding of trustworthy machine learning</li>
  <li>Explainable and interpretable AI</li>
  <li>Robust decision making under uncertainty</li>
  <li>Futuristic concerns about trustworthy machine learning</li>
  <li>Game-theoretic analysis for socially responsible machine learning systems</li>
  <li>Case studies and field research of the societal impacts of applying machine learning in mission-critical and human-centric tasks</li>
</ul>

Reviewing will be performed in <b>double-blind</b>, with criteria include:
<ul>
  <li>Quality of the methodology and experiments</li>
  <li>Novelty</li>
  <li>Relevance</li>
  <li>Societal impacts</li>
</ul>

<h2>Author Instructions</h2>
Papers should be submitted to OpenReview: <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2022/Workshop/TSRML">https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2022/Workshop/TSRML</a>

<h3>Submission Format</h3> 

Submitted papers are recommended to have at most <b>6 pages</b> with unlimited bibliography and appendix, using TSRML 2022 LaTex style files:
<ul>
  <li><a href="/assets/author_templates/tsrml_2022.tex">tsrml_2022.tex</a> - LaTeX template</li>
  <li><a href="/assets/author_templates/tsrml_2022.sty">tsrml_2022.sty</a> - style file for LaTeX 2e</li>
  <li><a href="/assets/author_templates/tsrml_2022.pdf">tsrml_2022.pdf</a> - example PDF output generated by running "pdflatex"</li>
</ul> 
The page limit is not hard, but keeping your paper reasonably short and concise can greatly improve readability. Submissions must be <b>anonymous</b> following <a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2022/CallForPapers">NeurIPS double-blind reviewing guidelines</a> and <a href="https://nips.cc/public/CodeOfConduct">NeurIPS Code of Conduct</a>. 
Accepted papers will be hosted on this workshop website but are considered non-archival and can be submitted to other workshops, conferences or journals if their submission policy allows.

<h3>Dual submission policy</h3>
We allow dual submission with other workshops or conferences. You can also submit papers that have some overlaps with your recently published papers. However, we <i>disallow</i> papers that are presented at the NeurIPS main conference as well as other machine learning conferences.
